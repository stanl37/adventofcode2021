## Advent of Code 2021

## Repo Details
This repository contains my solutions to the 2021 iteration of Advent of Code. I'm creating my solutions in C, to continue practicing this language. I will try to solve all solutions so they work on a general level, although I won't include much defensive coding or other unneccessary bits. I will also try making my code as dense and efficient as possible.
